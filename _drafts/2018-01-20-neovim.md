I recently switched from Vim to Neovim. One month later, I've experienced nothing but delight. 
Neovim is snappier, works better out of the box, and has been perfectly compatible with my Vim configs!

Benefits I noticed
* snappier
* better
* stronger

## Setting Up Neovim
### Install Neovim with Python Support
1. On Mac, `brew install neovim`
2. Add python support, `pip install neovim`

*if you have python2 and python3, then run `pip2` and `pip3` install*

Launch neovim with `nvim` from the command line. 

To verify correct installation, run `:CheckHealth` from Neovim.

### Configure Neovim

* .config and dotfile sync
* install plugins with vim plug

## Editing
* polyglot: indentation and syntax highlighting
* cursor looks nice
* markdown spell check
* linter in the background
* autocompletiong using tab

## Working with Multiple Files
* nerdtree
* ctrl p
* why and what are buffers? 
* tab buffer switching

## Searching in and across Files
* Ack
* search settings: automatically highlighted
