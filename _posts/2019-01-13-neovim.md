I recently switched from Vim to Neovim. One year later, I'm delighted. 
Neovim is snappier, works better out of the box, and has been perfectly compatible with my Vim configs!

Under the hood, Neovim supports asynchronous execution. 
This means tools like linters run in the background without slowing down the editing experience.

## Setting Up Neovim
### Installing Neovim with Python Support
1. On Mac, `$ brew install neovim`
2. Add python support, `$ pip install neovim`

*if you have python2 and python3, then run `pip2` and `pip3` install*

Launch neovim with `nvim` from the command line. 

To verify correct installation, run `:CheckHealth` from Neovim.

### Configuring Neovim

* `.config/nvim/init.vim` is the neovim equivalent of a `.vimrc`
* I sync my configurations using a [dotfiles](https://github.com/marksibrahim/dotfiles) repo on GitHub. This backsup my configurations and helps quickly setup any machine I use.
* I manage plugins using [vim plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Vim plug keeps plugins in `init.vim` along with configurations.
    * running `:PlugInstall` will search `init.vim` for plugins to install

## Editing
One example of the saner defaults is the cursor: thin means you're in insert mode. 

*  indentation and syntax highlighting: [polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot)
* markdown spell check: add `autocmd FileType markdown setlocal spell` to `init.vim`
* linter in the background: [ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) supports multiple languages
* auto-completion using tab: [supertab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab) and [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) to make completion asynchronous

## Working with Multiple Files
Vim and Neovim unfortunately have several confusing concepts for having multiple files open. 
A window is a view into a buffer. 
Multiple windows can view the same buffer. 
There are also tabs, which are unfortunately laggy if you have too many open. 
Instead, what we think of tab in most applications, is actually a **buffer**. 
That's what I use to view multiple files. 

I configured `tab` to switch buffers by adding:

{% highlight bash %}
nnoremap <Tab> :bnext<CR>
nnoremap <S-Tab> :bprevious<CR>
{% endhighlight %}

Two plugins make file navigation easy

* [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) gives file navigation similar to sublime and Intellij. Handy for a view of a project's file structure:
![Nerdtree]({{ site.url }}musings/images/nerdtree.png)

* [Ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim). Just type `Ctrl-P` for fuzzy file matching, it's wonderful:
![Ctrlp]({{ site.url }}musings/images/ctrlp.png)


## Searching in and across Files
* [Ack](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim), a very fast grep across a set of file. By default, this is set to the current directory. To search use
`:Ack [pattern]`

This searches across files in the directory and supports regex for more advanced searches.


One year later, Neovim gets a big thumbs up!
