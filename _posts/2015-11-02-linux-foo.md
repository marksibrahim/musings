### Repeating Commands

**ctrl+p** shows the last command, without blindly executing it like **!!**

**ctrl+r** for searching your command history (ctrl-r again shows next match)

### Find versus Grep

**Find** searches for filenames and directories

**Grep** searches *within* files or directories

Usage:
* grep word file.txt
* grep -r word directory
