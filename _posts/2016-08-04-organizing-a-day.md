summary:    How I track and prioritize tasks in Omnifocus

Inspired by the workflows of many other Omnifocus gurus, I developed a daily routine to  track and prioritize how I spend my day.

# Foundation
The workflow relies heavily on a foundation of life goals---ideally 4-5 goals. For me these include: Surviving (by that I mean paying bills, tracking errans, and other tasks that I simply need to accomplish to survive), Engaging with friends, Becoming a Better Mathematician/Programmer, and Building cool projects. Each goal is a Folder underwhich I create projects.

For each broad goal, I create projects (which are specific steps, which would help me accomplish the goal. For example, under Becoming a better progammer, a project might be to study algorithms. This project isn't a task I can accomplish in a sitting---it's a step towards becoming a better programming made up of many tasks.

# Throughout the Day
As I go about my day, inevitably all kinds of tasks come up. Rather than holding these tasks in memory or spending time to put each one in a proper bucket or every moment deciding whether to work on the task or not, I use the inbox to dump any incoming tasks.
Omnifocus on the iphone helps make this easier even if I don't a full-screen application running.

Email is one large source of these tasks. Ideally, I try to check email systematically a handful of times a day. Each email should be processed into a task, marked as done, or delayed until it's relevant. I use Google Inbox, which has a nice interface for doing this.


# Morning Ritual
To decide who I'll spend a day, I dedicate a 25 min to an hour every morning populating and processing my Omnifocus inbox. First, I turn any communication from Slack, email, or other messages into tasks in my inbox. Then, I categorize each into it's proper place within my existing projects under a particular goal (creating new ones as needed). 

Doing so, naturally filters which tasks are more relevant by the priority of a given goal or project. Finally, I systematically go through each goal/project and decide what the most important tasks for the day are, marking those with a flag and a context. 
I also keep an eye on tasks with deadlines (or defer tasks until they are relevant--similar to email).


Each flagged task gets a context: priority, next, dreamy. Priority is the task I'm working on now or one that's the first one I want to accomplish. As I finish this task, I mark one of the next tasks as priority. Finally, dreamy tasks are ones taht would be nice to accomplish, but not necessary.

If particularly important tasks comes up, I can always refer to the goals/projects and reshuffle the contexts as necessary. In some cases, I find it helpful to block off particuarl times of the day on a calendar for certain tasks or simply use pomdoro technique to pick-off tasks throughout the day. 
Yes, I did create a Omnifocus tasks to write this blog post!
