summary:    How I track and prioritize tasks

*Update (December, 2016): I now use ToDoist to organize my day in much the same fashion. I find the interface is a bit more modern, syncing across devices is faster, and the ability to collaborate with others quite handy!*

Inspired by workflows of many Omnifocus gurus, I developed a routine to  track and prioritize how I spend my day.

## Foundation
The workflow is based on life goals---ideally 4-5. For me these include: 

![goals]({{ site.url }}musings/images/life_goals.png)

Each goal is a **Folder** containing projects.
Projects are steps towards a goal. To become a better programmer, I may create a project to study algorithms. Not so hard!

![projects]({{ site.url }}musings/images/projects.png)

A project requires several tasks: read chapter 1, complete exercises 2.3, watch a tutorial on sorting. Each task is specific: something I can accomplish in an hour or two.

## Throughout the Day

Inevitably tasks come up throughout a day. Rather than juggling priorities or todos in my mind, I dump tasks into the **Inbox**: 

![inbox]({{ site.url }}musings/images/inbox.png)

When I'm not sitting at my computer, there's a handy iPhone app to capture anything I want to do.

Email is large source of tasks. I try to check email only a handful of times per day. Ideally, I touch each email once: I turn an email into a task, mark it as done, or defer it until it's relevant. I find [Google Inbox](https://www.google.com/inbox/) is a nice interface for accomplishing this.


## Morning Ritual
To decide how to spend a day, I dedicate about a half an hour every morning to populate and process the Inbox: 

<ol type="1">
  <li> Turn any communication from Slack, email, or platforms into tasks in my Inbox. 
  </li>
  <li>
   Categorize each task into a project 
   <ul>
   <li>
   add a <i>due date</i> if I need to deliver a task by a certain date 
  </li>
   <li>
   <i>defer</i> until a later date (when task is relevant)
   </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

Next, I go through each goal, prioritize the projects under each: 

<ul>
<li>
<b>Flag</b> tasks I want to take on today
</li>
<li>
Assign each a one of three <b>Contexts</b>: 
<i>priority</i>,<i> next</i>, and<i> dreamy</i>
</li>
</ul>

<i>Priority</i> is the first task or two I'd like to take on for the day (typically the most important); <i>Dreamy</i> are is for tasks that would be nice to accomplish, but not necessary; and <i>Next</i> for the rest.

## Accomplishing Tasks

As I begin working on a task I move it from <i>next</i> to <i>priority</i>. On some days, I find it helpful to block-off times on my calendar for a particular task or use the [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) technique---I use an app called [Pomodoro One](http://rinik.net/pomodoro/) for this.
The order of tasks, projects, and goals helps me visually prioritize what I should be working on. Et voila!

In case you've been wondering, I did create a task for this post.
